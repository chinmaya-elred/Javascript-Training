                <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a

                    <a href="#" class="info-modal"
                        data-text="JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted and weakly typed programming language which was built with the purpose of running in host environments (e.g. inside of a webpage in the browser).">dynamic,
                        interpreted</a>
                    and
                    <a href="#" class="info-modal"
                        data-text="Weakly typed means that variables in JavaScript are not bound to a specific data type, and their types can change during runtime.">weakly
                        typed</a>
                    programming language which was built with the purpose of running in
                    host environments (e.g. inside of a webpage in the browser).
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's part of pretty much any page you visit in the web as it's the
                    only "thing" in web development that allows you (= the developer) to
                    change something on the page at runtime. Basically everytime
                    something opens, closes, moves or changes on a webpage, JavaScript
                    will be involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There also a lot of webpages which are almost entirely powered by
                    JavaScript (i.e. where a lot of the rendering work happens in the
                    browser) - those pages typically use frameworks like Angular, but
                    that's a topic we'll cover later in the course. :-)
